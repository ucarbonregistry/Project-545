The project titled “132 MW Sugarcane Bagasse based co-generation Energy USINA CORURIPE” is 
a 100% Brazilian company headquartered in the city of Coruripe, Alagoas, with five production units: 
one located in Coruripe (AL), and four in the state of Minas Gerais, in the municipalities of Iturama, 
Campo Florido, Limeira do Oeste, and Carneirinho. 
Altogether, the units have a combined crushing capacity of 16.2 million tons of sugarcane per harvest 
season. 

Coruripe uses sugarcane bagasse as biomass for energy generation. The bagasse, which is rich in 
cellulose, is burned in boilers to produce steam, which is then converted into thermal energy and 
subsequently into renewable electricity through a cogeneration process. 
The energy generated not only supplies the industrial units and administrative offices but also enables 
the surplus to be sold in both the regulated and free markets, contributing to a more sustainable energy 
system by replacing fossil-based energy sources. 

Among all units, energy export is distributed as follows: 
___________
Carneirinho Unit (UTE Carneirinho): equipped with two 12 MW generators, totaling 24 MW of 
installed capacity, with an energy export contract of 13 MW. 
__________
Iturama Unit: divided into two thermal power plants (UTEs): - - 
___________
UTE Usina Iturama: has one 20 MW generator, with an export contract of 12 MW; 
___________
UTE Coruripe Energética Iturama: has two 12 MW generators, totaling 24 MW of installed 
capacity, with an energy export contract of 22 MW. 
_________
Campo Florido Unit: divided into two thermal power plants (UTEs): - - 
__________
UTE Usina Coruripe Campo Florido: equipped with one 30 MW generator, with an energy 
export contract of 15 MW; 
______
UTE Coruripe Energética Campo Florido: equipped with one 30 MW generator, with an 
energy export contract of 30 MW.
